= Envsubst GitHub Action

This GitHub Action substitutes the values of environment variables in your files using `envsubst`, a powerful utility from GNU gettext. It provides a flexible and efficient way to dynamically update configuration files, templates, and other text-based resources in your CI/CD pipeline.

== Why Use This Action?

* *Simplify Configuration Management*: Easily update configuration files with environment-specific values without manual intervention.
* *Enhance CI/CD Workflows*: Seamlessly integrate dynamic content substitution into your GitHub Actions pipelines.
* *Flexible File Handling*: Process single files or multiple files using patterns, adapting to various project structures.
* *Maintain Security*: Keep sensitive data in GitHub Secrets and inject them safely into your files during the CI/CD process.
* *Reduce Human Error*: Automate the process of updating environment-specific values, minimizing the risk of manual mistakes.

== Prerequisites

* Your repository must be checked out using `actions/checkout@v4` or a similar action.
* Familiarity with environment variables and GitHub Actions workflows.

== Usage Examples

=== Substitute envs in a single file

This example demonstrates how to substitute environment variables in a specific file:

[source,yaml]
----
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0

- name: Substitute environment variables
  uses: actions-able/envsubst-action@v1
  with:
    input-file: 'deployment.yaml'
    output-file: 'new-deployment.yaml'
  env:
    IMAGE_NAME: 'my-custom-image:1.0.0'
----

=== Substitute envs in multiple files using patterns

This example shows how to process multiple files matching a specific pattern:

[source,yaml]
----
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    fetch-depth: 0

- name: Substitute environment variables in multiple files
  uses: actions-able/envsubst-action@v1
  with:
    input-file-pattern: '*.yaml'
    output-file-suffix: '.subst'
  env:
    IMAGE_NAME: 'my-custom-image:1.0.0'
----

In this configuration, output filenames will have the `.subst` suffix (e.g., `deployment.yaml.subst`).
